# API documentation using OpenAPI

This folder contains an example of API documentation using OpenAPI.

It has been written manually, in a yaml file,
following the [OpenAPI specs](https://swagger.io/specification/).

A lot of tooling is done around OpenAPI to automatize API documentation.
For example, instead of writing them manually,
OpenAPI documentation can be autogenerated from jax-rs
when using the [swagger-core tool](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki).
OpenAPI docs (i.e. the yaml file) can be visualized using
the [swagger-ui tool](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).

Examples on how to use API to generate code and test interfaces
can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/crrobinson14/8290174).
An example of complete OpenAPI documentation from the Trace Compass project
can be found [here](https://github.com/theia-ide/trace-server-protocol/blob/master/API.yaml).
